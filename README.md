## Release
- [6/13] 🫧 We uploaded model weight of [Valley-13b-v1-delta](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/valley-13b-v1-delta).
- [6/12] 🫧 We released Valley: Video Assistant with Large Language model Enhanced abilitY.  Checkout the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07207.pdf).

## Todo
- ~~Release inference code~~
- ~~Upload weight of **Valley-v1**~~ and build a share link demo
- Release 47k instruction tuning data 
- Upload pretrain and tuning code

## Install
1. Clone this repository and navigate to Valley folder
```
git clone https://github.com/RupertLuo/Valley.git
cd Valley
```
2. Install Package
```
conda create -n valley python=3.10 -y
conda activate valley
pip install --upgrade pip 
pip install -e .
```
## ValleyWeight
We release [Valley]() delta weights weights to comply with the LLaMA model license. You can apply this delta weights to original LLaMA model weight through the instructions blew:

1. Get the original LLaMA weights in the huggingface format by following the instructions structions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
2. Use the following scripts to get Valley weights by applying our delta ([13b-v1](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/valley-13b-v1-delta)).
### Valley 13b v1
```bash
python3 valley/model/apply_delta \
    --base /path/to/llama-13b \
    --target /output/path/to/Valley-13B-v1 \
    --delta luoruipu1/valley-13b-v1-delta
```

## Inference Valley in Command Line


inference CLI
```
python3 inference/run_valley.py --model_name [PATH TO VALLEY WEIGHT] --video_file [PATH TO VIDEO] --quary [YOUR QUERY ON THE VIDEO]
```
