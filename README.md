## Install
1. Clone this repository and navigate to Valley folder
```
git clone https://github.com/RupertLuo/Valley.git
cd Valley
```
2. Install Package
```
conda create -n valley python=3.10 -y
conda activate valley
pip install --upgrade pip 
pip install -e .
```
## Data
In the pretrain stage, we use the data from [LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain) and the [Valley-webvid2M-Pretrain-703K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/luoruipu1/Valley-webvid2M-Pretrain-703K) collected and filtered by ourselves. The acquisition of picture and video data can refer to [LLAVA]( https://llava-vl.github.io/) and [Webvid](https://github.com/m-bain/webvid) 

In the finetune stage, we use the data from [LLaVA-instruct-150K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K), [VideoChat-instruct-11K](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo/tree/main/Data/instruction_data) and our self-collected [Valley-Instruct-73k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/luoruipu1/Valley-Instruct-73k). For the images and videos of the first two parts, please refer to their official website. Here we describe how we obtain the data we collect ourselves ([Valley-Instruct-73k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/luoruipu1/Valley-Instruct-73k)).

1. Part of Valley-Instruct-73k is collected from the open source dataset [VATEX](https://eric-xw.github.io/vatex-website/explore.html), which contains about 20k downloadable videos. You can download the original annotation file ("ava_vatex_training_v1.0.json") from its official website. Its video comes from YouTube, and now there are many open source tools that can download YouTube videos by video id. We provide a tool to download its videos, the tool is located in the [Crawler](./Crawler/) folder, please read the tool's [Readme.md](./Crawler/README.md) to use it.
2. Another part of Valley-Instruct-73k is collected from a video site, named [JukinMedia](https://www.jukinmedia.com/). It contains a wide variety of videos.  We also provide a tool to download jukinmedia videos and its high quality descriptions, the tool is located in the [Crawler](./Crawler/) folder, please read the tool's [Readme.md](./Crawler/README.md) to use it.


## ValleyWeight
### Valley 13b v1
We release [Valley-13b-v1](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/valley-13b-v1-delta) delta weights weights to comply with the LLaMA model license. You can apply this delta weights to original LLaMA model weight through the instructions blew:

1. Get the original LLaMA weights in the huggingface format by following the instructions structions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
2. Use the following scripts to get Valley weights by applying our delta ([13b-v1](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/valley-13b-v1-delta)).
```bash
python3 valley/model/apply_delta.py \
    --base /path/to/llama-13b \
    --target /output/path/to/Valley-13B-v1 \
    --delta /path/to/valley-13b-v1-delta
```
### Valley2 7b 
For the Valley2-7b model, we provide direct weights, the address is [here](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/Valley2-7b)

### Chinese Valley 13b
We now support **Chinese valley**. We use "BelleGroup/BELLE-LLaMA-EXT-13B" as LLM backbone, and  "OFA-Sys/chinese-clip-vit-large-patch14" for visual backbone, the address is [here](https://huggingface.co/Zhaoziwang/chinese_valley_v1).

### Pretrain Weight
We provide [13b](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/valley-13b-pretrain) and [7b](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/Valley2-7b-pretrain/) pre-trained weights so that people can fine-tune directly on our pre-trained weights with their own fine-tuning data.

## Web UI
<p align="center">
    <img src="valley/logo/demo.GIF" width="100%"><br>
</p>

The framework of this webUI comes from [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), we modified a part of the code to make this demo support the input of video and images.
#### launch a controller
```bsah
python valley/serve/controller.py
```
#### launch a model worker
```bsah
python valley/serve/model_worker.py --model-path /path/to/valley-13b-v1
```
Ps: At present, only single card mode is supported to load the model, and at least 30G of video memory is required, so the graphics card needs at least one Tesla V100.
#### launch a gradio demo 
```bash
python valley/serve/gradio_web_server_video.py --share
```


## Inference Valley in Command Line
We now update inference code which is more convient, and supports input in the form of openai api.

Inference CLI
```
python3 inference/run_valley.py --model-name [PATH TO VALLEY WEIGHT] --video_file [PATH TO VIDEO] --quary [YOUR QUERY ON THE VIDEO]
```

Inference Chinese Valley
```
python3 inference/run_valley.py --model-name [PATH TO CHINESE VALLEY WEIGHT] --video_file [PATH TO VIDEO] --quary [YOUR QUERY ON THE VIDEO] --system-prompt "你是大型语言视觉助手 Chinese-Valley。你能够理解用户提供的视觉内容或视频，并使用自然语言协助用户完成各种任务。请仔细按照人类的指令进行回答，并详细解释你的答案。"
```

Inference in code
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from valley.model.valley import ValleyLlamaForCausalLM
def init_vision_token(model,tokenizer):
    vision_config = model.get_model().vision_tower.config
    vision_config.im_start_token, vision_config.im_end_token = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids([DEFAULT_IM_START_TOKEN, DEFAULT_IM_END_TOKEN])
    vision_config.vi_start_token, vision_config.vi_end_token = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids([DEFAULT_VI_START_TOKEN, DEFAULT_VI_END_TOKEN])
    vision_config.vi_frame_token = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(DEFAULT_VIDEO_FRAME_TOKEN)
    vision_config.im_patch_token = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids([DEFAULT_IMAGE_PATCH_TOKEN])[0]

device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
# input the query
query = "Describe the video concisely."
# input the systemprompt
system_prompt = "You are Valley, a large language and vision assistant trained by ByteDance. You are able to understand the visual content or video that the user provides, and assist the user with a variety of tasks using natural language. Follow the instructions carefully and explain your answers in detail."

model_path = THE MODEL PATH
model = ValleyLlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
init_vision_token(model,tokenizer)
model = model.to(device)
model.eval()

# we support openai format input
message = [ {"role":'system','content':system_prompt},
            {"role":"user", "content": 'Hi!'},
            {"role":"assistent", "content": 'Hi there! How can I help you today?'},
            {"role":"user", "content": query}]

gen_kwargs = dict(
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.2,
    max_new_tokens=1024,
)
response = model.completion(tokenizer, args.video_file, message, gen_kwargs, device)
```


## Train Valley Step By Step

Inspired by LLAVA, we adopt a two-stage training method. The pre-training stage uses the [Valley-webvid2M-Pretrain-703K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/luoruipu1/Valley-webvid2M-Pretrain-703K) and [LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain).  And fine-tune stage uses [LLaVA-instruct-150K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K) ,  [VideoChat-instruct-11K](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo/tree/main/Data/instruction_data)  and [Valley-Instruct-73k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/luoruipu1/Valley-Instruct-73k)

We modified our code for training valley and managed the model hyperparameters with yaml files. Run the following two scripts to perform valley training.

### Pretrain
The llm backbone that currently supports pre-training is Llama(7b,13b), vicuna(7b,13b), stable-vicuna(13b), Llama2(chat-7b, chat-13b). You need to download these open source language model weights yourself and convert them to the huggingface format. 
```shell
bash valley/train/train.sh valley/configs/experiment/valley_stage1.yaml
```

#### Finetune

```shell
bash valley/train/train.sh valley/configs/experiment/valley_stage2.yaml
```
