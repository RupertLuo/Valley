Understanding Complex Videos Relying on Large Language and Vision Models

[[Project Page](https://valley-vl.github.io/)] [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07207.pdf)]~[[demo]()]~

The online demo is no longer available, because we released the code for offline demo deployment

## Release
- [7/23] ü´ßWe modified the code of our training model to make it easier to train valley and support the training of lora and llama2
- [7/5]  ü´ß Release training code for valley, and upload our pretraining data 
- [6/21] ü´ß upload offline demo code.
- [6/14] ü´ß build a share link ~[[demo]()]~.
- [6/13] ü´ß We uploaded model weight of [Valley-13b-v1-delta](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/valley-13b-v1-delta).
- [6/12] ü´ß We released Valley: Video Assistant with Large Language model Enhanced abilitY.  Checkout the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07207.pdf).

## Todo
- ~~Release inference code~~
- ~~Upload weight of **Valley-v1** and build a share link demo~~
- ~~Upload offline demo code~~
- ~~Release 703k pretraining data~~ and 40k instruction tuning data 
- ~~Upload pretrain and tuning code~~
- Upload weight of Valley-GLM-6B and Valley-v3

## Install
1. Clone this repository and navigate to Valley folder
```
git clone https://github.com/RupertLuo/Valley.git
cd Valley
```
2. Install Package
```
conda create -n valley python=3.10 -y
conda activate valley
pip install --upgrade pip 
pip install -e .
```
## ValleyWeight
We release [Valley]() delta weights weights to comply with the LLaMA model license. You can apply this delta weights to original LLaMA model weight through the instructions blew:

1. Get the original LLaMA weights in the huggingface format by following the instructions structions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
2. Use the following scripts to get Valley weights by applying our delta ([13b-v1](https://huggingface.co/luoruipu1/valley-13b-v1-delta)).
### Valley 13b v1
```bash
python3 valley/model/apply_delta.py \
    --base /path/to/llama-13b \
    --target /output/path/to/Valley-13B-v1 \
    --delta /path/to/valley-13b-v1-delta
```
## Web UI
<p align="center">
    <img src="valley/logo/demo.GIF" width="100%"><br>
</p>

The framework of this webUI comes from [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), we modified a part of the code to make this demo support the input of video and images.
#### launch a controller
```bsah
python valley/serve/controller.py
```
#### launch a model worker
```bsah
python valley/serve/model_worker.py --model-path /path/to/valley-13b-v1
```
Ps: At present, only single card mode is supported to load the model, and at least 30G of video memory is required, so the graphics card needs at least one Tesla V100.
#### launch a gradio demo 
```bash
python valley/serve/gradio_web_server_video.py --share
```


## Inference Valley in Command Line

inference CLI
```
python3 inference/run_valley.py --model-name [PATH TO VALLEY WEIGHT] --video_file [PATH TO VIDEO] --quary [YOUR QUERY ON THE VIDEO]
```



## Train Valley Step By Step

Inspired by LLAVA, we adopt a two-stage training method. The pre-training stage uses the [Valley-webvid2M-Pretrain-703K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/luoruipu1/Valley-webvid2M-Pretrain-703K) and [LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain).  And fine-tune stage uses [LLaVA-instruct-150K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K) ,  [VideoChat-instruct-11K](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo/tree/main/Data/instruction_data)  and Valley-instruct-40K (Still generating and cleaning, Valley-13b-v1 trained from previous 2 dataset) 

We modified our code for training valley and managed the model hyperparameters with yaml files. Run the following two scripts to perform valley training.

### Pretrain

```shell
bash valley/train/train.sh valley/configs/experiment/valley_stage1.yaml
```

#### Finetune

```shell
bash valley/train/train.sh valley/configs/experiment/valley_stage2.yaml
```
